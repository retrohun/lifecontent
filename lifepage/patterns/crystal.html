Crystal&decay 2700
A p150 gun fires at a pair of pentadecathlons.  When the first glider
hits the PDs, it is reflected back and hits the second, forming a
honey farm.  Subsequent gliders form a crystal growing upstream.  When
the crystal reaches an eater near the gun, it begins to decay.
When it's all gone, the cycle begins again.
The period of this pattern is 2700, but by moving the PDs, any period
of the form  750 + 1950n  (n>=0)  can be obtained.
