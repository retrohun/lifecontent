<H1>c/5 Orthogonal spaceship</H1>

<EM>Subject: An orthogonal c/5 ship</EM>
<P>
Eight solid weeks of cpu time on a Pentium Pro
133 and an average of 5 Hypersparcs for six weeks
have finally resulted in success in my width 9
search for a c/5 symmetric orthogonal ship with
dead cells down the middle (actual width 19).
The Pentium Pro had the actual honors of spitting
the ship out last night.
<P>
Source code for my search program is available to
anybody who wants it.  It now has a usage statement,
command line options, and checkpointing.  It still
has no comments in the main code.  The checkpointing
format allows fairly easy chopping of a search into
multiple pieces through the use of "head" and "tail"
and thus distributing the work among multiple CPUs.
<P>
Upon reading some of Harold Mackintosh's writing I
have learned that my search algorithm can quite
precisely be described as being an extender of DeBruijn
diagrams.  Over the next couple of months I am planning
to write up a more complete description of my algorithm.
<P>
I've been searchin' so long,
<P>
